                Through many research and educational partnerships, University Of Ghana faculty exercise daily leadership in the fields of information 
                technology, networking, cybersecurity, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics and more.
                They work closely with nonprofit agencies and industry clients to develop and mature technologies from concept through delivery to end-users. Our diverse 
                interdisciplinary research also extends into areas not traditionally 
                considered part of computer science. We invite you to explore our department websites to learn more about our research.
