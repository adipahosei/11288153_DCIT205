                Through many research and educational partnerships, University Of Ghana faculty exercise daily leadership in the fields of information 
                technology, networking, cybersecurity, machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics and more.
                They work closely with nonprofit agencies and industry clients to develop and mature technologies from concept through delivery to end-users. Our diverse 
                interdisciplinary research also extends into areas not traditionally 
                considered part of computer science. We invite you to explore our department websites to learn more about our research.
                Our leading experts are focused on research that's changing the way we interact with technology.

                            Developing advanced computational methods for automated image analysis and downstream data analytics,
                            The Computer Vision Group employs methods that are based on solid mathematical and statistical modelling,
                            as well as data-driven artificial intelligence using machine and deep learning. Research challenges include image 
                            restoration and reconstruction, super-resolution, image registration, object detection, segmentation, quantification, classification, tracking,
                            and multimodal analysis of visual and nonvisual data. Primary application areas investigated by the group include medical diagnostics, biological 
                            research, biomedical informatics, remote sensing, robotics, and manufacturing.

                            With interests in all aspects of machine learning, the research remit of the Machine Learning Group is broad. 
                            From analysing data in diverse representations such as graphs, images, time series and spatial data, to using 
                            state-of-the-art methods in data mining, deep learning, reinforcement learning, symbolic learning, learning theory 
                            and evolutionary computation. The group looks into various application domains, including bioinformatics, biomedical 
                            image analysis, cybersecurity, human-computer interaction, robotics and recommender systems.  .

                        <p>
                            A fundamental assumption in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is that an agent's 
                            knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated 
                            reasoning engines. The assumption that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is 
                            common in many modern intelligent systems. Our main strengths are in cognitive robotics, reasoning 
                            about actions and change, AI systems with general intelligence, and computer game playing.  .
