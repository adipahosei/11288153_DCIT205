            Our Program Description
        </h3><hr>
        <p>
            Our doctoral programme is a full-time research programme with expected duration 
            of 4-years. For the successful completion of this programme, a high level of commitment is required.
            Students are therefore expected to reside close to the University and be a full-time participant in the program. With guidance from postgraduate committee, Ph.D. students will create a personalized program of 
            study that includes a major area of specialization and at least two minor areas of specialization.
            In addition to coursework, the department holds regular seminars where students and faculty review and critique research in the field. To foster prudent critique, 
            students are expected to join at most one research lab and participate in research activities carried out by the group. The research areas of the department are Intelligent Space and Machine Learning, 
            Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Networking and Communications Engineering, and Cyber Security.<br>
            The PhD program in computer science prepares students to undertake fundamental and applied research in computer science, and it is available for those of high ability who seek to develop and implement their own research studies.<br><p></p>
            Students pursuing the doctorate in computer science learn to analyze, understand and apply key theories and algorithms used in the field and to generate and evaluate 
            new theories, algorithms and software modules that can advance the field of computer science.<br><p></p>
            The program provides students with research opportunities in a wide variety of areas, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Computational biology</li>
                <li>artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistical modeling</li>
                <li>big data and data mining</li>
                <li>networking and computer systems</li>
                <li>cyber-physical systems and IoT, and robotics</li>
                <li>novel computing paradigms (e.g., biocomputing, quantum computation)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Admission Requirement
        </h3><hr>
        <p>
            Applicants are eligible to apply to the program if they have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, computer engineering or a closely related area.
            Most applicants should have earned a master's degree, but exceptional undergraduate applicants may be admitted directly into the doctoral program.<br><p></p>

            Applicants must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.50 (scale is 4.00 = "A") in the last 60 hours of their first bachelor's degree program, or they must have 
            a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.50 (scale is 4.00 = "A") in an applicable master's degree program.<br><p></p>
            All applicants must submit:
            <ul>
                <li>graduate admission application and application fee</li>
                <li>official transcripts from every university attended</li>
                <li>three letters of recommendation</li>
                <li>a statement of purpose</li>
            </ul>
